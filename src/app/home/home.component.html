	<h1>Angular & Custom Elements</h1>
	<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements"
			target="_blank">Custom web elements</a> are powerful features of modern web development because they are
		framework-agnostic. Which means that you can use them in -basically- the same way no matter what framework are
		you using.</p>
	<p>Time ago I developed a very useful set of UI tools: a <b>loader</b>, <b>dialog</b> and <b>toast</b> based on
		<i>custom web
			elements</i>, and there are samples about how to implement them with React, Svelte and Vue.
	</p>
	<ol>
		@for (i of links; track i.id){
		<li>
			<a href={{i.url}} target="_blank">OA custom elements with {{i.label}}</a> &raquo;
		</li>
		}
	</ol>
	<p>That's fine, but what about <b>Angular</b>? Well the Angular implementation was on hold until I revamped my
		website <a href="https://oscaralderete.com" target="_blank">https://oscaralderete.com</a>, and that happened
		last month!</p>
	<p>Also, another reason for the delay was the way Angular process custom web elements, it's a little bit tricky. But
		because my website has a image slider, I decided to use Swiper because it has a cool web element version, ideal
		for Angular. At the end it was to kill two birds with one stone: Swiper slider and my OA user interface toolkit
		based on web elements.</p>

	<p><b>PS:</b> There's a running version of this repo: <a

		found this resource useful give me a Github star üëçüëçüëç.</p>
