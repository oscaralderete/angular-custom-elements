# Custom Web Elements and Angular
## How to integrate Web Elements with Angular v19

Hi, this time I'm sharing code to learn how to use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements" target="_blank">Custom Web Elements</a> with the -on the date- last version of Angular.

I'm using 2 custom web elements: Swiper (the famous responsive slider with tons of options) and my OA UI/UX toolkit to deal with dialogs, toasts and loader. I must warn you that it's a little bit tricky because following the documentation doesn't work. But no problem, at the end you have functional code that you can replicate in your own NG project.

There's a running version of this code: <a href="https://inmuebles.oscaralderete.com/" target="_blank">https://inmuebles.oscaralderete.com</a>. And remember, if you find this resource helpful, then give me a Github star!
